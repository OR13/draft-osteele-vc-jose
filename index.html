      <p>
        This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular
        revisions. It is not fit for production deployment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p class="advisement">
        This document does not reflect working group consensus, and its filled
        with flawed langauge and half baked arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] describes a JSON-LD representation for structured
        claims that an issuer can make about a subject, such that interested
        parties may be assured of semantic precision, integrity and
        authenticity.
      </p>

      <p>There are 3 categories of information in a Verifiable Credential:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Metadata</li>
        <li>Claims</li>
        <li>Proof</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In v1.1 we rely on JWT encodings for these categories of information
        which yielded a number of limitations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In v2 we should address the requirements of the core data model in a
        more generic way.
      </p>

      <p>
        We should avoid overloading terminology or conflating semantic or
        structured data attributes / statments/ claims with security terminology
        and standard properties of security serialization formats.
      </p>

      <p>
        We should design with the the intention of supporting a wider family of
        structured data representations including compact binary forms in the
        future.
      </p>

      <p>
        We should design with an open mind towards security work happening at
        IETF on the following lists:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/json/about/">JSON</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/cbor/about/">CBOR</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/jose/about/">JOSE</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/cose/about/">COSE</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rats/about/">RATS</a>
        </li>

          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/scitt/about/">SCITT</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We should leverage IANA registries for terms critical for
        interoperability:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Actors</h2>
      <p>
        [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] describes 3 primary roles an entity can play: issuer,
        holder, verifier. An actor is an entity that acts in at least 1 of the
        roles.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Issuing</h2>

        <pre class="example">
          credential -> header, payload (credential), signing capability -> verifiable credential
        </pre>

        <p>
          This section describes the action an <code>issuer</code> performs when
          acting in that role.
        </p>
        <p>An issuer first obtains all statements they wish to make.</p>
        <p>
          Next the issuer groups these statements into attributes, and at their
          discretion marks them as metadata or claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next the issuer determins the cryptographic material they intend to
          use to secure these attributes with a proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issuer might choose to register verification material prior to
          issuance or after the fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issuer determins which attributes MUST be understood by a
          verifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issuer formats their credential as a payload, constructs a
          security header and using a private key or signing capability
          constructs a verifiable credential using a software library.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issuer might optionally verify the newly minted credential after
          creating it, to ensure that 3rd parties will be able to perform the
          verififcation process successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issuer might optionally present the newly minted credential to a
          first holder, or communicate a capability to this holder using some
          established protocol for offering credentials.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Presenting</h2>

        <pre class="example">
          <- nonce, aud
          credentials, metadata -> presentation
          presentation -> header, payload (presentation), signing capability -> verifiable presentation
        </pre>
        <p>
          This section describes the action a <code>holder</code> performs when
          acting in that role.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holder first determins any required or optional credentials and
          metadata that a verifier accepts. It is possible the verifier
          advertises this according to some established protocol for requesting
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next the holder prepares their presentation, including any credentials
          and metadata they wish to disclose or prove to the verifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case that the verifier requires a fresh proof, or replay attack
          mitigation, the holder must obtain a required
          <code> nonce</code> value from the verifier. An optional
          <code> aud</code> value might also be chosen by the holder. A verifier
          might offer suggested nonce and aud values via a well known location,
          or might accept other credentials or tokens from some issuer trusted
          by the verifier to facilitate proof freshness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holder might choose to register verification material prior to
          presenting or after the fact (presentations might not be processed
          immediatly).
        </p>
        <p>
          Next the holder crafts their presentation as a payload and secures it
          using a protected header header and private key or signing capability.
          Using a software library the holder produces a verifiable
          presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holder might optionally verify the newly minted presentation after
          creating it, to ensure that 3rd parties will be able to perform the
          verififcation process successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holder might optionally transmit the verifiable presentation over
          a network, or to an internal software system or to a harware device
          via a transport protocol.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Verifying</h2>
        <pre class="example">

          verifiable credential -> header, payload, signature, public key -> 
            verified: true | false, 
            details: []

          verifiable presentation -> header, payload, signature, public key -> 
            verified: true | false, 
            credential details: []

        </pre>

        <p>
          This section describes the action an <code>verifier</code> performs
          when acting in that role.
        </p>

        <p>
          The verifier first obtains any required or optional credentials and
          presentations. Its possible the verifier advertises this according to
          some established protocol for requesting information.
        </p>

        <p>
          The verifier first obtains the holder's registered verification
          material and validates proof associated with the presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next the verifier checks all the required to be understood attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next the verifier might at their discretion reject presentations or
          mark them as invalid based on their own understanding of attributes.
        </p>

        <p>Next the verifier checks each credential presented.</p>

        <p>
          Next the verifier obtains the verification material for each
          credential issuer, and uses a software library to check the credential
          proof.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next the verifier might at their discretion reject credentials or mark
          them as invalid based on their own understanding of attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The verifier might store the presentation, credentials or just the
          claims and associated metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          The verifier might acknowledge receipt or acceptance / rejection of
          the presentation as a whole or in parts to the holder.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <p>
        [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] describes claims and metadata. An attribute is a
        claim, and/or metadata.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Producing</h2>
        <p>
          Header and payload and signature are produced by the issuer, or
          prover.
        </p>
        <p>
          Values for attributes in the header are more authoritative than those
          present in payloads.
        </p>

        <p>
          Issuers and provers MUST NOT create contradictng metadata or claims
          associated with the header values, in the payload.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          A verifiable credential is produced when a <code>credential</code> is
          used as a JWS Payload and secured with a protected header and
          signature.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Consuming</h2>

        <p>
          A verifier MUST process the header and understand all critical values
          in it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Metadata associated with the security of the payload is exclusive to
          the header.
        </p>

        <p>
          Values for attributes in the header are more authoritative than those
          present in payloads.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once a credential or presenation has been verified, the header can be
          ignored and the payload becomes the source of truth for claims made by
          the issuer.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          A credential is consumed when a <code>verifiable credential</code>,
          represented as a header, payload and signature is verified using a
          public key trusted by the verifier.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Header</h2>

        <p>
          See
          <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html#section-4"
            >JWS Header Parameters</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          See
          <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html#section-4"
            >JWE Header Parameters</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>Headers MAY contain <a href="#attributes">attributes</a>.</p>

        <p>
          Actors MUST understand all <a href="#attributes">attributes</a> marked
          critical via the header.
        </p>

        <p>
          The header is in a sense a collection of metadata about the
          "statements" or "claims" the issuer is making about the payload and
          its security properties.
        </p>

        <p class="advisement">
          The security of the serialization scheme comes exclusively from
          processing the header, payload and signature using the verification
          material. The header and payload must be treated as opaque until this
          process has suceeded or failed. Leveraging of <code>iss</code> and
          <code>kid</code> as a hint to obtain the verification material is the
          only exception to this rule.

            The "crit" (critical) Header Parameter indicates that extensions to
            this specification and/or [JWA] are being used that MUST be
            understood and processed. Its value is an array listing the Header
            Parameter names present in the JOSE Header that use those
            extensions. If any of the listed extension Header Parameters are not
            understood and supported by the recipient, then the JWS is invalid.
            Producers MUST NOT include Header Parameter names defined by this
            specification or [JWA] for use with JWS, duplicate names, or names
            that do not occur as Header Parameter names within the JOSE Header
            in the "crit" list. Producers MUST NOT use the empty list "[]" as
            the "crit" value. Recipients MAY consider the JWS to be invalid if
            the critical list contains any Header Parameter names defined by
            this specification or [JWA] for use with JWS or if any other
            constraints on its use are violated. When used, this Header
            Parameter MUST be integrity protected; therefore, it MUST occur only
            within the JWS Protected Header. Use of this Header Parameter is
            OPTIONAL. This Header Parameter MUST be understood and processed by
            implementations.

        <h2>Authority of the verification material</h2>
        <p>
          The verification material (public key or certificate) is the ultimate
          authority regarding the security of the serialization of the data
          model.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hints used to obtain this material such as <code>iss</code>, or
          <code>kid</code> ought to be helpful, but are not required to be.
        </p>

        <p>For example:</p>

        <pre class="example" title="Hints don't really matter.">
          {
            "iss": "https://gov.example",
            "kid": "did:example:789#key-234",
            "alg": "ES256"
          }
        </pre>

        <p>
          A verifier might choose to hash this object and then lookup a
          certificate. If the verifier trusts the certificate, that is all they
          need to proceed to processing the associated payload.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some actors might rely on defined protocols for obtaining keys or
          certificates based on hints.
        </p>

        <p>
          A verifier is not required to disclose how they obtain the issuer's
          key material.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Opacity of claims</h2>
        <p>Issuers are not required to disclose attributes in plaintext.</p>
        <p>
          This might result in awkwardness for the holder, as they cannot see
          what claims are in a given credential.
